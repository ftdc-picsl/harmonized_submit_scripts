This directory contains the 'harmonized' scripts for the ADRC and FTDC to submit T1 (and eventually hopefully other modalities) data for processing
We use the containers in /project/ftdc_pipeline/ftdc-picsl
For this version, we use 
    -pmacsT1wPreprocessing-0.5.1 for brain masking with the neck trim
    -pmacsAntsnetct-0.2.2 for the segmentation and cortical thickness estimate
...put the links here, chris
